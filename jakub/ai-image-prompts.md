## Tips for Best Results

1. **Always attach the relevant dashboard screenshot** when the prompt references the dashboard — AI tools can use it as reference for screen content
2. **Aspect ratios matter**: Use 16:9 for hero/wide sections, 4:3 for feature sections, 1:1 for portraits
3. **Consistent style**: Pick one variation style across all sections (e.g., all "premium product mockup" or all "lifestyle photography") for visual cohesion
4. **Color consistency**: The landing page uses a dark theme with teal (#00e5c8) as primary accent — make sure generated images match this palette
5. **Try Midjourney first** for photographic prompts, **Ideogram** for text/graphic prompts, **DALL-E 3** for quick iterations
