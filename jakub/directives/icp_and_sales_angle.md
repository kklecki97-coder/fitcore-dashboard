# Directive: Ideal Client Profile & Sales Angle

## The Business Model

We build custom client management dashboards for online fitness coaches. Kamil builds the product, Claude helps tailor it fast per client. Jakub finds and closes the coaches.

**Pricing (starting point):**
- **$300-500 one-time setup fee** — gets cash in the door, validates demand, low barrier
- **$50-100/month maintenance/hosting** — add this after delivery, creates recurring revenue
- Revisit pricing after first 5-10 clients. If demand is strong, raise prices.

**Why one-time fee first (not subscription):**
- No product to demo yet — coaches won't subscribe to something they can't see
- A one-time fee feels like hiring someone to build something, not committing to yet another SaaS
- Once they're using it and love it, the monthly fee for hosting/updates is an easy upsell
- You get paid before building — this is how agencies work and it de-risks your side

## Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

### The Person
- **Independent online fitness coach** (not gym employee, not franchise trainer)
- **Manages 15-50 clients** — fewer than 15 = can manage in their head, more than 50 = probably already has a system
- **Charges $100-300/month per client** — so they're making $1,500-15,000/month revenue
- **1-3 years in business** — established enough to have real clients, early enough to not have built their own systems
- **Solo operator or maybe 1 assistant** — no dev team, no tech person on staff
- **English-speaking** — US, UK, Australia, Canada (start with US)

### The Pain (in their own words)
These are the things coaches actually complain about online:
- "I spend more time on spreadsheets than coaching"
- "I keep losing track of who needs a check-in"
- "My clients message me on 5 different platforms"
- "I can't take on more clients — I'm maxed out at 20"
- "I look unprofessional sending workouts via WhatsApp"
- "Trainerize is too expensive / too rigid / doesn't do what I need"

### The Dream
What they actually want:
- One place to see all their clients and their progress
- Automated check-in reminders so nobody falls through the cracks
- Look professional and premium to justify their $200/month coaching fee
- Scale from 20 to 40+ clients without doubling their hours
- Stop paying $100+/month for Trainerize/TrueCoach that doesn't fit their workflow

### Disqualifiers (skip these coaches)
- Coaches with <10 clients — can't afford it, don't feel the pain yet
- Coaches who are mostly in-person at a gym — they need scheduling software, not a dashboard
- Coaches with 100+ clients — they already have systems, harder to sell to
- Coaches who are also "business coaches" selling courses — different buyer, different pain
- Anyone who already loves their current tool — don't try to convert the happy

## The Sales Angle

### What You're Selling (not a SaaS, not an app)
You're selling a **custom-built coaching dashboard** — emphasis on "custom" and "built for you."

This is NOT:
- Another subscription tool they have to learn
- A generic app that kind of fits
- Something they have to set up themselves

This IS:
- A dashboard built specifically for how THEY coach
- Tailored to their workflow, their check-in schedule, their metrics
- Done-for-you setup — they tell you what they need, Kamil builds it

### The Pitch (core message)
> "We build custom client dashboards for online coaches. You tell us how you run your coaching — check-ins, progress tracking, communication — and we build you a dashboard that does it all in one place. No generic app, no learning curve. Built for your workflow. $X setup, done in [timeframe]."

### Why This Beats Competitors
| Them (Trainerize, TrueCoach, etc.) | You |
|-------------------------------------|-----|
| $100-300/month subscription | $300-500 one-time + $50-100/mo |
| Generic features for everyone | Built for YOUR workflow |
| You configure it yourself | Done-for-you setup |
| Rigid — can't customize | We adjust anything you need |
| You're one of 10,000 users | Personal service, direct line |

### Objection Handling

**"I already use Trainerize/TrueCoach"**
→ "How much are you paying? Most coaches I talk to are spending $100-200/month on features they don't even use. We build exactly what you need for a one-time fee."

**"I can't afford it right now"**
→ This person has <15 clients or is bad at pricing. Skip them — they're not ICP.

**"What does it look like?"**
→ This is a buying signal. Show them a demo/mockup (Kamil needs to build this). Until then: "It depends on your workflow — every dashboard we build is different. Can I ask you a few questions about how you run your coaching?"

**"I just use spreadsheets and it's fine"**
→ "How many clients do you have right now? Most coaches I talk to hit a wall around 20-25 clients where spreadsheets start breaking. When you get there, we're here."

**"How long does it take?"**
→ "Typically [X days/weeks] from our first call to a working dashboard." (Confirm timeline with Kamil)

## Segmentation for Outreach

When building your lead list, tag each coach with a segment so you can personalize emails:

| Segment | Description | Pain angle in email |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Scaling coach** | 20-40 clients, posting about being busy/overwhelmed | "Scale past 30 clients without more hours" |
| **Premium coach** | Charges $200+/mo, polished brand | "Match the quality of your coaching with a professional dashboard" |
| **Tool-frustrated** | Currently uses Trainerize/TrueCoach, complains about it | "Stop paying $150/mo for features you don't use" |
| **Spreadsheet coach** | Manages everything in Google Sheets/Excel | "Your clients deserve better than a spreadsheet" |
| **New-ish coach** | 10-20 clients, growing fast | "Set up the right systems now before it gets chaotic" |

## What Needs to Happen Before First Outreach

1. **Kamil builds a basic demo/mockup** — even screenshots or a Loom video of a prototype. You need SOMETHING to show when coaches ask "what does it look like?"
2. **Jakub scrapes first batch of leads** — see `find_coaches.md` and `scrape_leads.md`
3. **Agree on delivery timeline with Kamil** — "how fast can you build a dashboard once we close a client?" This goes in the email.
4. **Set up a simple landing page** — even a Notion page or Carrd site. Coaches will Google you.
